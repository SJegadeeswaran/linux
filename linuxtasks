Ques: We are working on hardening Apache web server on all app servers. 
As a part of this process we want to add some of the Apache response headers for security purpose. 
We are testing the settings one by one on all app servers. As per details mentioned below enable these headers for Apache:

    Install httpd package on App Server 2 using yum and configure it to run on 8083 port, make sure to start its service.
    Create an index.html file under Apache's default document root i.e /var/www/html and add below given content in it.
    Welcome to the xFusionCorp Industries!

    Configure Apache to enable below mentioned headers:
    X-XSS-Protection header with value 1; mode=block
    X-Frame-Options header with value SAMEORIGIN
    X-Content-Type-Options header with value nosniff

Note: You can test using curl on the given app server as LBR URL will not work for this task.

Answer:

sudo yum install httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd		

edit on the below file with Listen 8083
nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  [On RHEL/CentOS]

Listen 8083

netstat -tulpn | grep :80
netstat -tulpn| grep apache	

Edit the following in the httpd.conf file:

<IfModule dir_module>
    DirectoryIndex index.html
    Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
    Header always set x-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
    Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
</IfModule>	in the /etc/httpd/conf httpd.conf
